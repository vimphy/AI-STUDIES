Absolutely, Rennan! Here's a slide-style presentation outline you can use to explain the concepts of text summarization and the techniques behind it. It's compact, structured, and beginner-friendly—perfect for educational or internal use.

🧠 Slide 1: What Is Text Summarization?
Definition:
Text summarization is the process of condensing a large body of text into a shorter version while preserving its key information and meaning.
🎯 Common Uses:
- News digests
- Academic abstracts
- Legal briefings
- Meeting and call transcripts
- Summarized game or lore content (like Elden Ring!)

🔍 Slide 2: Main Techniques & Their Differences
| Technique | Method | Strengths | Limitations | 
| Extractive | Selects key sentences directly from text | Preserves source accuracy | Can feel robotic or choppy | 
| Abstractive | Rewrites and paraphrases using language models | More fluent, human-like output | May require more data and compute | 


🧵 Summary:
- Extractive is sentence-based selection.
- Abstractive is idea-based generation and paraphrasing.

🚀 Slide 3: Popular AI-Based Summarization Techniques
⚙️ Extractive Methods
- TextRank
✅ Fast, language-independent
❌ May pick redundant sentences
- LexRank
✅ Good for multi-docs
❌ Sensitive to similarity threshold
- TF-IDF
✅ Simple, interpretable
❌ Misses semantic nuance
- LSA
✅ Captures latent themes
❌ Ignores syntax and word order

✨ Abstractive Methods
- Seq2Seq Models (RNN, LSTM)
✅ Human-like summaries
❌ Needs large training data
- BART
✅ Noise-robust, high performance
❌ Heavy resource demand
- T5
✅ Multi-task powerhouse
❌ Complex prompt tuning required
- PEGASUS
✅ Tailored for summarization
❌ Narrower use outside of summarization
- GPT Variants
✅ Zero/few-shot friendly
❌ Prone to factual drift

Definition
Text summarization is the process of reducing a large document into a compact version that retains its essential meaning and core ideas. The goal is to produce readable and relevant summaries that improve information consumption speed and understanding.

📌 Key Applications:
- News aggregation platforms like Flipboard or Pocket
- Academic abstracts and journal summarization
- Legal and financial briefs
- Chatbots and voice assistants
- Lore/World summaries for games (like our Elden Ring example!)
- Internal document distillation for business intelligence

🧪 Common Summarization Workflow Steps
| 🔢 Step | 🔍 Description | 
| 1. Preprocessing | Clean and tokenize text: remove stopwords, punctuation, etc. | 
| 2. Representation | Convert text to vectors using TF-IDF, word embeddings, or transformer encoders | 
| 3. Scoring & Selection | Determine sentence or phrase relevance via frequency, similarity, or semantic weight | 
| 4. Summary Creation | Extract or generate the summary based on the chosen technique | 
| 5. Postprocessing | Refine grammar, coherence, and remove duplicates or redundancies | 


This workflow can differ based on whether you’re using extractive or abstractive methods—but the general structure holds for most AI-based summarizers.

lide 5: O que são Tokens?
🔍 Definição:
Tokens são unidades mínimas de texto — como palavras, caracteres ou subpalavras — resultantes do processo de tokenização, que divide uma sequência de texto em partes úteis para análise e modelagem.

📖 Exemplos de Tokenização
| Tipo | Descrição | Exemplo | 
| Por Palavras | Divide o texto em palavras completas | “Estou estudando aprendizado de máquina” → [Estou, estudando, ...] | 
| Por Caracteres | Cada caractere vira um token | “Eu” → [E, u] | 
| Por Subpalavras | Fragmenta palavras em blocos menores, ideal para termos raros ou novos | “aprendizado” → [aprendi, zado] | 



💡 Por que Tokens Importam?
- 🔧 Pré-processamento: Facilitam a remoção de ruídos e a padronização textual
- 🧠 Modelagem: Modelos de linguagem como BERT e GPT trabalham diretamente com tokens
- 📐 Análise Sintática: Permitem estruturar frases para extração de significado e construção de árvore sintática

🎯 Conclusão
Tokens são a base de todo projeto de NLP e fundamental para tarefas como classificação de texto, resposta automática, análise de sentimentos e sumarização. Compreender seus tipos e usos torna qualquer modelo mais eficiente e preciso.

 Slide 5: What Are Tokens?
🔍 Definition:
Tokens are the smallest meaningful units of text — such as words, characters, or subwords — created through a process called tokenization, which splits a sentence into manageable chunks for analysis.

📖 Types of Tokenization
| Type | Description | Example | 
| Word Tokenization | The most common approach—splits text into full words | “I'm learning machine learning” → [I'm, learning, machine, learning] | 
| Character Tokenization | Breaks text into individual characters, useful for languages with complex symbols | “Hi” → [H, i] | 
| Subword Tokenization | Used by models like BERT and GPT—splits words into parts or syllables | “learning” → [learn, ing] | 



💡 Why Tokens Matter
- 🔧 Preprocessing: Tokens help clean and prepare text before analysis
- 🧠 Modeling: NLP models process text by working directly with tokens
- 📐 Syntactic Analysis: Tokens support grammar parsing and meaning extraction

🎯 Bottom Line
Tokens are the foundation of NLP systems. Understanding how they work—and how they’re structured—can significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of your machine learning projects.
